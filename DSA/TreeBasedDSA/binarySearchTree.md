The properties below of binary search trees allows for efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations, with time complexities that are generally **O(log n)** in average cases, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Properties

- All nodes of left subtree are less than the root node
- All nodes of right subtree are more than the root node
- Both subtrees of each node are also BSTs i.e. they have the above two properties
