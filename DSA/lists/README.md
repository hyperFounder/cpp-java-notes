## List Data Structure

A **List** is a linear data structure that allows you to store a collection of elements. Lists can store elements in a sequential manner and allow you to access elements by their position (index).

#### **Types of Linked Lists:**
- **Singly Linked List**: Each node points to the next node, and the last node points to `NULL`.
- **Doubly Linked List**: Each node contains two pointers: one pointing to the next node and one pointing to the previous node.
- **Circular Linked List**: The last node points back to the first node, forming a circular chain.
